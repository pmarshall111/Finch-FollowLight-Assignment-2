Plan:

- Definitely going to need better maths for how fast our finch is going. We only really get up to about 150 wheel vel.
So only 60% of max speed. Rather disappointing.

- Potentially need to try it out in rooms of different ambient lights. Could forsee a situation where I take in my Finch to show but have only tested the program in dark rooms
so the light doesn't work so well.


Could do something simple like just making it go 255 if far and 0 if close

As the intensity nears the min intensity needed for light detection we need to go super fast.


Changes we need to make.

- Ideally if it loses the light we must assume that it has gone out of range and shoot forward till we find it?
- Smoother operation?
- Do we want to dynamically set the min light intensity depending on the environment???
- Split finchFollow into 2 funcs
- Decide whether we want to keep this finchKeepDistance, or perhaps do something like finchInterested, finchScared. Where it turns around and runs away from the light. Definitely keep
the keepDistance around though in case we want to do something with it.
- Potentially an opportunity to add an additional circuit on top of the finch with a switch, which could activate the thermometer? What would that do???
- Change in light intensity needs to be brighter and proportional to how different it is to the minimum light intensity we're looking to catch
