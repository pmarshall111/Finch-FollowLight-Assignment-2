Plan:

- Definitely going to need better maths for how fast our finch is going. We only really get up to about 150 wheel vel.
So only 60% of max speed. Rather disappointing.

- Potentially need to try it out in rooms of different ambient lights. Could forsee a situation where I take in my Finch to show but have only tested the program in dark rooms
so the light doesn't work so well.


Could do something simple like just making it go 255 if far and 0 if close

As the intensity nears the min intensity needed for light detection we need to go super fast.


TODO:

1. Ensure stats arraylist is working
2. Make a func to go through the previous iteration and see if the light level is increasing or decreasing.
